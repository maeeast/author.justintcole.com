          <h3>About the Book</h3>
          <p>
            The Cat Who Lit Itself on Fire and Other Mostly-True, Mostly-Humorous Tales is a collection of 41 autobiographical experiences presented for your amusement.<br><br>
            Unlike my fiction stories, these anecdotes don't contain layers. They are what they are and they are best consumed with a light heart.<br><br>
            All stated dates are to my best recollection and could be in error.<br><Br>
            This book is currently with an Editor so word counts and general contents are subject to change between this page and final publication.
