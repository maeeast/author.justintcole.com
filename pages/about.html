<h2>About the Author</h2>

<p>
I have <i>always</i> enjoyed good stories. As a small child, I enjoyed having them read to me and, of course, I enjoyed my cartoons. <br>
<br>
In the summer prior to my 10th birthday I discovered the joy of autonomous reading and I couldn't be stopped.<br> 
<br>
I discovered science fiction and promptyly devoured all of the books in my school's (very limited) library. I then ripped my way through the slightly-larger collection available in the town's public library. <br>
Before long books encorached on the coveted #1 spot for gifts, creating an endless battle between the most interesting titles and more Legos.<br>
<br>
In high school my personal library grew by mass-purchasing used books whenever I traveled out in the world all while I ransacked the school library for new and interesting titles. <br>
<br>
In college, though, is where the words began to find me. Stories would force their way out of my mind rather than me forcing them into it. <br>
Most of these have been lost as the notebooks in which I scribbled are long gone... but the act itself only grew. <br>
<br>
A few years ago I was curious if I was producing anything worthwhile so I tested the metaphorical waters of Reddit. I fully-expected to encounter mockery and laughter and a massive explosion of down-votes.<br>
To my utter amazement, the exact opposite happened.<br>
<br>
I was receiving hundred, and then thousands, of views... and the upvote numbers kept rising.<br>
<br>
I wondered if I had posted enough on Reddit to make a book and, to my own shock and amazement, I had MULTIPLE books' worth of stories.<br>
<br> 
I decided to smash the stories I had shared to Reddit in with all of the other stories I hadn't shared with anyone and I discovered enough material to launch 10 volumes of short stories into the world.<br>
<br>
So I began my journey into publishing. That's where you come in. Now you can experience the stories I have dropped on Reddit <strong>AND</strong> the other stories.

  <h3>‚úçÔ∏è Writing Style</h3>
  <p>
   My style is concise. My stories are not long. There aren't massive passages of descriptions. My short stories set up the plot and punch you with the hard points of the stories quickly. Perhaps, someday, I will develop enough skill to enhance my work into longer forms and explore the worlds I create more fully.
