  <h3>The Little Fox</h3>
  Subgenre: Uplifting. 1,318 Words.
  <blockquote>
  The little fox never wanted to be but he wants, less, to be forgotten.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  Unlike the other works in my books, where the artwork is the result of the story, this story is the result of the artwork. The artwork was drawn for a different story. To me, it did not mesh with the tone of the story but I absolutely LOVED the artwork itself. I immediately told the artist I wanted to buy it for use in the future. The story, which works perfectly as the introduction to a potential future novel, is a result of my love of the artwork and the inspiration it gave me. I liked it so much that I bumped it forward from being in Volume 8 to this volume, displacing two other stories slated for inclusion in this book. I hope you enjoy this concept as much as I do. Written in 2024.
