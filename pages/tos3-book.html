          <h3>About the Book</h3>
          <p>
            There is a growing disdain for "NuTrek" among the fan base. Nearly all of the complaints derive from a derision of the idea of "woke ideology" being inserted into Star Trek.<br><br>
            Star Trek has <strong>ALWAYS</strong> been "woke." <strong>ALWAYS.</strong><br><br>
            There are other books out there that have investigated the rumors of how the show was created and examined how much of the "wokeness" was intentional and how much may have been accidentally placed but, regardless of the output of all of those causative investigations, the end result broadcast content that qualifies as "woke" by nearly every interpretation.<br><br>
            This volume covers the third season of The Original Series in an episode-by-episode approach. It is compiled by doing an intense, and very deliberate, viewing of each episode coupled with note-taking and alaysis about the content.<br><br>
            The criteria for wokeness are a blend of my own interpretations of what it means to "be woke" AND filtering the episodes through the lens of criteria compiled by an anti-woke website, <a href="https://www.notwokeshows.com/criteria">Not Woke Shows</a> (be forewarned, they use a lot of advertising to make money off their hatred).
            This book will take you, bit by bit, through all of the specific categories of "wokeness" presented in each episode, starting with the first, failed, pilot. This book will prove that "wokeness" has ALWAYS been a part of Star Trek and, therefore, those who hate "wokeness" and who despise left-leaning politics can only be fans of Star Trek if they miss the entire point, and multi-layered, messaging within the show.<br><br>
            Star Trek is, and always has been, "woke."
