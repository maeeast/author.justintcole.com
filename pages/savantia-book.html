        A man stumbles upon an extraordinary mirror that lets him see alternate realities of his self. 
        An astronaut on the moon watches in trepidation as an asteroid is about to hit Earth. 
        Determined to prove her worth, a "crazy scientist" unveils her latest invention, and it exceeds all her expectations. 
        Two groups of children fight over playing territory at a park, forcing the adults to step in. 
        An immortal being, tired of existence, attempts one last-ditch effort to end it all. 
        A rescue team discovers the ridiculous reason that led to the destruction of a ship and its crew.
        <br><br>
        Author Justin T. Cole presents a diverse collection of stories spanning multiple genres, focusing on themes that explore different facets of the human condition. 
        These tales will shock you, make you feel wonder and awe, and question the very nature of human existence. 
        Whether you're a fan of sci-fi, fantasy, or literary fiction that makes you ponder, this anthology evokes a wide range of feelings and emotions with compelling narratives that 
        will keep you hooked from start to finish. Cole doesn't take much time to set up the characters or the plot, and drops the reader into the midst of the action from the get-go. 
        It's one of the most entertaining short story collections I've read all year. Savantia and Other Speculative Stories is a must-read for all short story lovers." - Pikasho Deka, Reader's Favorite. 5-Star Review</li>
